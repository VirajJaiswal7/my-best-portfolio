          I have built several exciting and high-quality projects that showcase
          my skills as a MERN Stack developer. <br /> From a real-time chat app
          like WhatsApp, to a full-featured Job Portal,
          <br /> to an Uber-style ride booking platformâ€”each project
          demonstrates my ability to create dynamic,
          <br />
          responsive, and user-friendly web applications. Explore some of my
          best work below.
